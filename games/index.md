## Game Jams
### Close Enough (GMTK Game Jam 2024)
A project I did with David Babazadeh (currently an ML Master's student at Berkeley).

The theme for the jam was "Built to Scale," so we made a game where you have to resize two objects in order to get them to be the correct relative scale. We both shared programming responsibilities, I did the art, and he did the music. The jam was four days long, and this project was done in Unity. Unfortunately, we made a mistake at the very last moment and didn't submit properly to the game jam, but you can still play the game [here on itch.io](https://summedup.itch.io/close-enough). I think the game is rather fun and clever for what it is, and I think you could get some good laughs out of it.

### Various DGA Game Jams
I've competed in 2 DGA (Cornell Development in Games Club) game jams thus far, and plan to compete in 1 more before graduation. I will post more info here shortly.
### Spin to Win (Pirate Jam 16)
The theme was "You are the Weapon," and we made a physics-driven game where you are a beyblade-like top with weapons growing out of you. You need to assemble the best assortment of weapons to beat your opponent. Our game was heavily inspired by autobattlers like *The Bazaar* and *Team Fight Tactics*.

Our gameplay came out a bit underbaked, but it was a worthwhile learning experience for us all. My teammates were Anthony Langer (art and UI) and Oren Dror (music). I did the programming and game engine work for this game, and it was done in Unity.
