# Swipe Tactics

Swipe Tactics (name subject to change) is a mobile strategy game inspired by *Clash Royale*, *UFO 50*'s *Attactics*, and RTS games.

This is a project for Cornell's Advanced Game Design course (CS/INFO 4152). As of right now (12/16/25 is when I'm writing this), we are still in very early development.
Our game will be released in late spring/early summer 2025 with releases on IOS and Android.
