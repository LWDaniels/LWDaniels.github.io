## Game Jams
### Close Enough (GMTK Game Jam 2024)
A project I did with a close friend, David Babazadeh.

The theme for the jam was "Built to Scale," so we made a game where you have to resize two objects in order to get them to be the correct relative scale. We both shared programming responsibilities, I did the art, and he did the music. The jam was four days long, and this project was built in Unity. Unfortunately, we made a mistake at the very last moment and didn't submit properly to the game jam, but you can still play the game [here on itch.io](https://summedup.itch.io/close-enough). I think the game is rather fun and clever for what it is, and I think you could get some good laughs out of it.

### Spin to Win (Pirate Jam 16)
The theme was "You are the Weapon," and we made a physics-driven game where you are a beyblade-like top with weapons growing out of you. You need to assemble the best assortment of weapons to beat your opponent. Our game was heavily inspired by autobattlers like *The Bazaar* and *Team Fight Tactics*.

Our gameplay came out a bit underbaked, but it was a worthwhile learning experience for us all. My teammates were Anthony Langer (art and UI) and Oren Dror (music). I did the programming and game engine work for this game, and it was done in Unity.

### DGA/Cornell-related game jams
#### Untitled (DGA Jam Winter 2024-25)

The theme for this jam was *Spirit*.

I largely used this as an opportunity to experiment with some post-process shaders (as in the background and chromatic aberration), as well as an opportunity to make some basic music and art. I completed this game jam solo. This game was made in Unity.

This game won most innovative in that game jam.

#### Mazzie's Mission in the Mimic Museum
![mazzies_mimic_museum](/assets/mazzie_attack.png){:class="img-responsive" width="50%"}

The theme for this jam was *Halloween*.

This game is a prop-hunt-inspired game where you clear out a museum of the mimics lying within. The mimics only move toward you if you aren't looking at them. If you break too many real artifacts, you lose. Mazzie has a basic attack ability and an ability to reveal the mimics around her (which takes more mana). This game was made in Unity and used free assets from [here](https://9e0.itch.io/witches-pack) and some other itch.io asset packs.
